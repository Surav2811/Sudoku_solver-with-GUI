# Sudoku_solver-with-GUI
This is a project in Python and uses pygame to create a GUI for Sudoku.
The Solver uses the backtracking algorithm. 
Run GUI.py to play sudoku.

For those who do not know the rules or are new to the game.
Sudoku rules are simple and straightforward. It is precisely their simplicity that makes finding the solution and solving these puzzles a true challenge.
Rule 1 - Each row must contain the numbers from 1 to 9, without repetitions
Rule 2 - Each column must contain the numbers from 1 to 9, without repetitions
Rule 3 - The digits can only occur once per block (nonet)
Rule 4 - The sum of every single row, column and nonet must equal 45
